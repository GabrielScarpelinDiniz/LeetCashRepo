# Problem 17
> Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

> A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

# How the problem works?

We need to take the digits inputed, and return all combinations of the letters that digits can represent. Like an old phone. It's a medium problem, but so difficult to think in solutions more "clean"

# How I solve the problem?

Is the bad solution that I can think, but to solve the problem fast I use this solution. In the problem requirements I see that we can only have 4 digits at maximium. So I use this, for "generate" a bad clean code that create one loop inside other if have one more letter, knowing that I can not have more than four letters.

Repeately, Is the bad code that I can think.
