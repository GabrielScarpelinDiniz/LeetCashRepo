# Problem 191

> Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

# How does the problem works?

We need to count all the bits that is set to one in the number

# How did I solve the problem works?

I solve transforming the bits of the number in a string, and I iterate for each bit counting the positives. Finally, I just return the value
