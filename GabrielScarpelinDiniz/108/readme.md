# Problem 108

> Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

# How does the problem works?

It's pretty simple: given an array of integers, we need only to return the binary search tree height balanced

# How did I solve the problem?

I solve the problem using the same logic cited on problem 109. I was always taking the middle on the array, treating as a subarray. This will generate a height balanced binary search tree.
