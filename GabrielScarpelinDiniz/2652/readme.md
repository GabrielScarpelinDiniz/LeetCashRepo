# Problem 2652

> Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

> Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

# How does I solve the problem?

I create a loop initializing by 1 and then I sum one in the variable. If the current number is divisible by 3, 5 or 7 we add the number to the final number. Then I return the result
