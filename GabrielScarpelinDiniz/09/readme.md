# Problem 09

> Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

# How the problems works?

We need to check if we reverse the number, the number will be the same. So, with the input is 121 we need to return true. Otherwise, we need to return false, so 423 is not equals when we reverse.

# How I solve the problem?

I solve the problem with the easiest solution. I convert the number into a string, sequentially a reverse the string and check with is equals compared to the original string. And return the result in the final of the function.
