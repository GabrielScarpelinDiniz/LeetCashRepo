# Problem 104

> Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

> A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# How the problem works?

We need to take the maximum depth in a binary tree.

# How I solve the problem?

I use the DFS (Depth First Search), using recursive function and always treating a subnode as the root, and taking the maximum comparing the left side or the right side.
