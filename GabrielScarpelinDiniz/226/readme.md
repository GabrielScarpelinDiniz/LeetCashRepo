# Problem 226

> Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

# How did the problem works?

We need only to invert the childrens of a binary tree

# How does I solve the problem?

I use recursion (DFS), to visit all node and going inverting each node. So, when I visit a node, I invert the childrens of them and I'm doing this for every node. It's a pretty simple solution that not takes more than 10 lines of code. Is very simple to understand the code too.
